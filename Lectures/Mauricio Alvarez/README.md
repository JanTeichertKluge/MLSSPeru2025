# Introduction to Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization

## Session 1: Introduction to GPs

In this session, you need to complete the scripts 

- ``sampling_GP_to_complete_matern.py``
- ``sampling_GP_to_complete_faster_rbf.py``
- ``prediction_GPs_to_complete.py``

**Solutions**

- ``sampling_GP.py`` contains the solutions to the sampling questions.
- ``prediction_GPs.py`` contains the solutions to the predictive probability.


## Session 2: Lab Session on GPs

You can run the Jupyter Notebook directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index). 

Click on the Colab Badge to open the notebook 

Introduction to Gaussian Processes Notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OLMOS-PM/MLSSPeru2025/blob/main/Lectures/Mauricio%20Alvarez/Python/Introduction_to_GPs_MLSS.ipynb#scrollTo=4VSYckTICC-L)

If you want to save changes to the Notebook, you need to save them before quitting. According to [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Rmai0dD30XzL):

> If you would like to save your changes from within Colab, you can use the File menu to save the modified notebook either to Google Drive or back to GitHub. Choose File→Save a copy in Drive or File→Save a copy to GitHub and follow the resulting prompts. To save a Colab notebook to GitHub requires giving Colab permission to push the commit to your repository.
